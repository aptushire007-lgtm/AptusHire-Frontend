// Real-time voice pipeline for the AI interview.
//
//  - TTS (spoken questions + the interviewer's backchannels): POST /interview-portal/voice/speak
//    → MP3 (proxied by our backend so the key stays server-side). Falls back to the browser's
//    SpeechSynthesis if the proxy is unavailable, so a question is always spoken.
//  - STT (spoken answers): stream mic audio to Deepgram's WebSocket using a short-lived token
//    from GET /interview-portal/voice/token. We accumulate the final transcript + confidence and
//    a couple of cheap delivery measurements (words/min, filler rate); richer prosody is added
//    server-side later.
//  - Turn-taking is hands-free AND conversational: silence no longer ends the turn on a timer.
//    It first buys the candidate reassurance out loud ("take your time — I'm here") and a much
//    longer window; once that patience is spent the interviewer ASKS ("anything you'd like to
//    add?") rather than simply stopping, and only then does silence end the turn. A manual
//    "Done" override is always available.
//    The asking step exists because candidates reported the timer-only ending as being cut off
//    mid-thought — which it was. It costs a few seconds and makes the end of a turn the
//    candidate's decision instead of a countdown's.
//
// What the interviewer may SAY is never decided here. The phrases and the timings arrive from
// the server (backend/utils/backchannel.js — a fixed, human-approved bank); this file owns only
// the real-time detection of when to use them, because that is the only thing the browser knows.
//
// Everything degrades gracefully: if the mic or socket fails, the caller can fall back to typing.
