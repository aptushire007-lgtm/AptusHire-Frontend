// logged as ABSENT. 512, up from 416 (itself up from 224), against a 640x480 capture (see
// useProctoring.js): a candidate sitting far enough back that their face fills only ~13-15% of
// frame was still landing detector scores of 0.6-0.7 at 416 — enough to clear the "detected"
// threshold but too low to be a confident read, and one bad frame away from a false face_absent.

// candidate's absence. A measurement of the detector and a measurement of the candidate are
// different propositions; the caller needs both to keep them apart.

// (a ~6MB model, tens of ms per call). Presence, multi-face and gaze need only the detector and the
